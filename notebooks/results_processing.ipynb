It consists of giving a score for the hyperonym relationship between two words $(w_1,w_2)$ expressing a degree that \"*$w_1$ is a hyponym of $w_2$*\". [Hyperlex dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02117v2.pdf) contains pairs of words with a score between 0-6. The score is the median of the ratings given by at least $10$ human annotators to the question \"*To what degree is $w1$ a type of $w2$?*\". The inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated with the average Spearman correlation $\\rho$ of a human rater with the average of all the other raters. It was obtained IAA $\\rho = 0.864$. This is considered an \"*upper bound*\" for the performance of automatic systems. Thus, the task is to give a score for all pairs in the dataset and report the Spearman correlation between the median human annotator scores and the calculated ones.\n",

        "In a nutshell, all the following models start with a set of non-contextual embeddings, such as Skip-gram, Glove, fastText embeddings (except for HyperVec and Poincaré embeddings that starts to train the embeddings from scratch), and using WordNet, ConceptNet or any other resource, they obtain a set of synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms/hyperonyms pairs of words. The set of pairs is used to train new embeddings by means of a specialized loss function that separate the synonyms/hyponyms from antonyms/hyperonyms. The above models differ in the chosen loss function. Once the model is trained, it is defined a distance function to give the hyponymy degree. The distance functions somehow use the Euclidean distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- HyperVec: For a vocabulary $V$, it is trained from scratch a word embedding $v_w$, for all $w \\in V$, in a similar fashion as Skip-gramm archictecture with negative sampling training objective (SKNS). The usual loss function in SKNS is modified adding some terms to learn *hierarchical embeddings* based on hyperonym/hyperonym hierarchy. It is needed to know the hyponyms/hyeronyms of the words (or at least of some words) during the training. The pairs of training hyponyms/hyperonyms come from WordNet. The final score is calculated with a distance function, *HyperScore*, that mixes the cosine distance and the norms of the calculated embeddings. The authors claim in the paper that all pairs in the evaluation datasets have been removed from the training dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Poincaré embeddings: Similar to HyerVec, embeddings for words in a vocabulary $V$ are trained from scratch. The embeddings are learned optimizing a loss function depending on an hyperbolic distance. Given a set of unordered pairs $D= \\{\\{u,v\\}\\}$, where one of $u$ and $v$ is an hyperonym of the other, the loss function uses as positive examples the pairs of $D$ and, similar to negative sampling, uses as negative examples $10$ pairs that are not in $D$. The unordered pairs of $D$ are obtained from WordNet. The main goal of the hyperbolic embeddings are to reconstruct the complete hierarchy of a network knowing its hyperonym relationships. For graded LE, the authors define a score function based on the norms of the vectors and the hiperbolic distance. \n",
        "\n",
        "- LEAR: The starting point of this method is a set of non-contextual trained word embeddings. In particular, the authors test with SKNS, CBOW, Glove and fastText embeddings. Inspired by the *Attract-Repel* framework, these embeddings are retrained to capture the hypernoym structure of the concepts giving higher and lower norms to word embeddings situated in higher and lower positions of the hierarchy, while trying that the cosine distance mantains its properties about the similiraty of the words. The embeddings are retrained with sets of Attract ($A$), Repel($R$) and Lexical Entailment ($L$) examples. These examples are pairs of words obtained from WordNet and Roget's thesaurus, where the $A$, $R$ and $L$ pairs are $(u,v)$ where $u$ is a synonym, antonym and hyponym of $v$, respectively. The authors use $1,023,082$ synonyms pair, $380,873$ antonym pairs and $ 1,545,630$ hyponym pairs. To solve the graded LE task, a distance over the trained embeddings is defined based on the difference of the norms of the embeddings. Since the hyperonym degree for a pair of words is calculated with a combination of the cosine and the Euclidean distances of the embeddings, and the loss function during training also contains the distance of the embeddings, it should not be trained with pairs that appear in the hyperlex dataset. But this point it is not discussed in the paper. There are only two papers that mention this problem with the training: GLEN and POSTLE. Both papers show that if the LEAR model don't see any word of the hyperlex dataset while the model is retraining, the results are worse. Note that \"*don't see any word*\" is a stronger condition that \"*don't see any pair*\".\n",
        "\n",
        "- SDNS: This paper is entirely devoted to graded LE. As in LEAR, the inputs of the model are non-contextual embeddings (dependency-based word embeddings, a generalization of the SKNS embeddings). A NN is defined that is trained with the scores in the train dataset, so it is a pure regression model. To obtain better results, the authors add to the NN some weights to incorporate: sparse distributional features, model called SDNS+SDF; and some  additional information (SDNS+SDF+AD) of some positive/negatives examples that are pairs of hyponyms/synomys (positive) and hyperonyms/antonyms (negative). These examples are again obtained from WordNet and are used in pretrain stage to push the vectors to the correct side of the decision boundary. They use $102,586$ positive pairs and $42,958$ negative ones. The authors do not inform if these pairs intersects with the Hyperlex pairs. These pairs are used only to push the embedding to the correct side by means of a hinge loss function in a preliminary training.  \n",

        "- GLEN: This model is inspired by LEAR. The difference is the loss function. It also uses sets of pairs of synonyms, antonyms and hyponyms in the training obtained from WordNet. But in this case the authors carry out tests with models that have seen during the training from the 0% to 100% of the words in Hyperlex. Moreover, they conducted the same experiments for LEAR. As it can be appreciated in the bellow table, the performance of LEAR without seeing the Hyperlex pairs is quite poor.

The latter reported Spearman correlation for LEAR should similar than the correlation reported in LEAR's paper, but it doesn't match at all : $0.533$ vs. $0.686$ (may be due to the initial embeddings?).

        "####**How baseline results are obtained**\n",
        "Except for SDNS model, all of the rest models are unsurpervised. But, as we disccuss above, the unsupervised models see the words in the Hyperlex dataset during training in the form of pair constraints. Thus, these models can be compared with our models trained with the datasets under the Hyperlex random configuration, since $100\\%$ of the words in train/val datasets are in the test dataset. GLEN and POSTLE papers also perform controlled experiments in such a way that during their training, it is not seen any word of the Hyperlex dataset, and they also do the same for the LEAR model. In this case, these models are compared with our models trained with the lexical configuration of Hyperlex. Thus, we get the comparable results with the random split from the regarding papers of all models, and the comparable results with the lexical split from GLEN, POSTLE and SDNS papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "####**Our proposal**\n",
        "An elemental form to give a LE grade is to use the probability $p_{hyp}$ for the the `hyp` label calculated by one of our masked/non-masked models: Greater/lower $p_{hyp}$, more/less sure we are that the pair represent an hyponym. But, let's say that one pair gets the probabilities $p_{hyp}=0.8$ and $p_{syn}=0.15$, an another pair obtains $p_{hyp}=0.8$ and $p_{syn}=0.05$. If we have two pairs with similar probabilities to be an hyponym, but one of them with higher probability to be a synonym, as in the above example, this could be an indication that the first pair should be given a higher *hyponym* degree. We can argue the same, but in the reverse sense, with other labels such as $p_{mero}$ or $p_{norel}$. Thus, if the calculated probabilities really represented the certainty about the lexical relations of two words, we could find a linear combination of the probabilities to obtain a grade for LE, that is, we could give some weights $\\beta_{hyp}, \\beta_{syn},\\beta_{norel}, \\dots$, such that knowing the probabilities of a pair $p_{hyp}, p_{syn},p_{norel}, \\dots$, we would get the hyperonym degree as the value, \n",
        "\n",
        " $$grade = \\beta_{hyp}p_{hyp}+\\beta_{syn}p_{syn}+\\beta_{norel}p_{norel} + \\dots$$\n",
        "Similarly, we can also use the logits instead of the probabilities to find the weights $\\beta_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "One simple way to obtain the weights is to use the validation set to fit a linear regression model where the response variable is the `grade` given by the human annotators and the predictors are the logtis produce by the fine-tuned model (we also tried to use the probabilities insted of logits, and the results were quite similar). The estimated regresion coefficients will be our weights. \n",
        "\n",
        "Our method follows:\n",
        "1. We collapse all `hyp-i` and `r-hpy-i` labels to `hyp` and `r-hyp`, respectively. Thus, we train the model/template with $7$ classes: `ant`, `syn`, `hyp`, `r-hyp`, `cohyp`, `mero` and `no_rel`. In early testing, it seemed that having too many labels and too little data was hurting performance. \n",
        "2. A model/template is trained with the train/val datasets as it is described in the paper. It is run $10$ epochs and the final model is the best one on the val dataset regarding the metrics: For non-masked trained models, the metric is the macro average; and for masked models, it is the cross-entropy loss for the masked tokens. \n",
        "3. Post-processing: Once the model/template is trained, it is calculated the predicted logit of the labels for each pair in the val dataset. Thus, we get a matrix $A = [l_i^j]$, where $l_i^j$ is the logit of the $j$-th label for the $i$-th pair in the val dataset. A linear regression model is fitted to predict the vector of the median human ratings $\\boldsymbol{r}_{val}=(r_1,\\dots,r_n)$. So, we obtain a vector of $7$ weights, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_7)$, such that,\n",
        "$$\\boldsymbol{r}_{val}\\approx \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\cdot M$$\n",
        "4. The vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is used to predict our rating: Given a pair in the test dataset, it is calculated its vector of logits  $\\boldsymbol{l}=(l_1,\\dots, l_7)$ for the labels; our final rating is $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{l}$.\n",
